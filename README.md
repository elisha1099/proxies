# The Best Guide to True Laziness.
This guide will walk you through all the things you can do on a school Chromebook. Some things are made by me and others arent. To be safe, if I didn't make something I will **explicitly** say so.

Guide written and made entirely by me, Elisha.

## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>
Welcome to this guide! If you're here you most likely know what this is, though if you don't, that's what this intro is for.
Here you can find things like proxies, games, bookmarklets, and more. This is meant to be like one central area to find all the shit you want, while also having guides on how to set everything up if you need it. Anything that's down or blocked can be reported to the issues tab (you will need a GitHub account without a school email) and I'll try to fix it or add a new link. Also, If you know me personally don't be afraid to ask me to add something. One last thing, if I am missing anything from the guides that makes it confusing or hard to understand, **please** leave an issue on the issue tab! That's all for now, go enjoy your day.

## Proxies. <a name="Proxies"></a>
Probably the only thing you came here for.
Proxies let you access practically any website on a school Chromebook even at school. They bypass most filters including Securly, Wifi Blocks, and sometimes even GoGuardian. The proxies talked about here are **not** made by me! Not any of them!

__________
### Bunker <a name="Bunker"></a>

Bunker itself is actually not a proxy, but it hosts them. It's runs them in a super hidden mode meaning your teachers with GoGuardian can't see the pages you're on, and it also keeps the pages from showing up in your history.

Please keep in mind that before doing this or accessing any websites **the district can still see any webiste you go on.** While this guide does bypass GoGuardian and WiFi blocks, the IP address still has to be pulled, meaning anything weird you access will still be logged as an IP address on the districts side, meaning any 

The last thing I have to say before starting this guide is that **I did not make Bunker!** I did not contribute in any way to the making of this program, I am simply making a guide for it, if you wanna go to the original page, its [here](https://github.com/JavaScythe/Bunker).

### Bunker Download <a name="DownloadBunker"></a>

Bunker is the most complicated to set-up but don't let that scare you because it's still really easy. Just follow the steps and you'll be just fine.

**Step 1** -
Start by going down to the assets section in the release section and download the `bunker-v5-beta.zip` file.

**Step 2** -
Open the files app on your chromebook by pressing the Search ![Search Icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44753505/157513886-7be09bc7-e9f8-4c29-a4f3-ca630019bb92.png) button. Navigate to the 'Downloads' folder then double-click the `bunker-v5-beta.zip` file to open it.

**Final Step** -
Drag and drop the `bunker-v5-beta` folder into your Google Drive folder in the sidebar. (If you don't have a Google Drive folder visit the help section below on steps to add it back to your sidebar)

#### Done!
At this point you're done downloading Bunker. All you need now to use it is initialize it. That takes it own set of steps and they have to be done every time you want to use Bunker on a different Chromebook, so for that reason it'll be it's own category.

### Bunker Initilization <a name="init"></a>

This is only part you have to follow if you've already done the download part, and you don't have to repeat the download per Chromebook either.

**Step 1** -
Open the files app on your Chromebook and open your Google Drive. Open the Bunker folder, this will be named `bunker-v5-beta` unless you changed the name manually, now, open the `launcher.html` file by double-clicking on it.

**Step 2** -
Where it says `select opening provider:` select `*.github.io`.

**Final Step** -
Press on `Initialize bunker index`.

#### Done!
After this you have full, unrestricted, and hidden internet access. You can access any website as far as I know so please don't be the person that ruins it for everyone by opening porn. Okay?

### Holy Unblocker <a name="HolyUB"></a>

Opening and using Holy Unblocker is very simple but wayyyy more restricted.

Start by going [here](https://winterguide.org.uk/?q#). Now just type in a website URL in full, or if you don't know the URL you can just copy and paste `www.google.com` and then find the website with Google.

##### Classic or Stealth?
Classic has better compatibility, while Stealth hides the sites you visit from your history.

## Bookmarklets <a name="bookmarks"></a>
Fun little things you can mess around with
Bookmarklets are small tools you can use to do multiple things with. Some let you play games, others are helpful, and some are just purely destructive. These don't and can't make any permanent changes so don't worry. If you can't get rid of one, just refresh the page.

### Downloading <a name="bookmarksdl"></a>
For most bookmarklets you have to manually add the page individually, but on here you can pick one of 2 options, downloading a pack or adding them manually. By downloading a pack you can get all Bookmarklets at once, but if you dont want all the Bookmarklets you can add them manually, adding them manually is probably easier but you have to add them one by one so if you want all of them, just get the pack. (The pack will also have games and a few other websites included.)

#### Manual <a name="manual"></a>

Adding bookmarklets manually is easy. To start go to the top of the page and open the `bookmarklets.md` file and follow the direcions.

#### Using a Pack <a name="pack"></a>

Using a bookmark pack is as simple as downloading the file and importing it. To import a bookmark pack, go to your [bookmark manager](chrome://bookmarks), then press the 3 dots in the top right and press import bookmarks. Find the pack file and open it, if you downloaded the pack from the release tab it'll be called `bookmarks-version.html`.

After importing the file, the folders should show up in your Bookmarks bar, and just like that you're good to go!
