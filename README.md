# The Best Guide to Internet Freedom.
This guide will walk you through all the things you can do on a school Chromebook.

## Proxies.
Probably the only thing you came here for.

The best proxy you can use on a restricted Chromebook is bunker. A javascript program that runs through a launcher which can boot Bunker using a provider that is unblocked at your school, usually ".github.io". Because Bunker is the best proxy to use, we will go over that first, then glance over the over the other proxies.

### Bunker Set-up.
Bunker itself is actually not a proxy, but it hosts them. It's runs them in a super hidden mode meaning your teachers with GoGuardian can't see the pages you're on, and it also keeps the pages from showing up in your history.

Bunker is the most complicated to set-up but don't let that scare you because it's still really easy.

The last thing I have to say before starting this guide is that **I DID NOT MAKE BUNKER!** I did not contribute in any way to the making of this program, I am simply making a guide for it, if you wanna go to the original page, its [here](https://github.com/JavaScythe/Bunker).
